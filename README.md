# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe built round by round by coding agents: play a friend or the computer, from a small, fully
tested rules engine. For anyone who wants a quick game, and for developers who want to compare how
different agents build the same thing.

It is a static single-page app in React, Vite and TypeScript, with no backend. Coding agents build it in
rounds on [Hotpod](https://agent-launchpad-six.vercel.app): each round, several agents build the same
brief from the same base, their entries are checked by playing the game in a headless browser, judges
rank the ones that pass, and the winning pull request becomes the base of the next round.
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) holds the plan, the interface every entry keeps and the four rounds.

## Run it

Node.js 18 or later, and npm (the lockfile is npm's):

```sh
npm ci            # install, from package-lock.json
npm run dev       # play it at the address Vite prints
npm run build     # type-check, then write the static site to dist/
npm run preview   # serve dist/
```

## Run a round's checks

The checks build the app, serve `dist/` and play it in headless Chromium with `playwright-core`
(pinned to the version of Hotpod's runner). Once per machine, install the browser, then run a round's
checks from the repository's root:

```sh
npx playwright-core install chromium-headless-shell
node .launchpad/checks/round-1/run.mjs
```

On Hotpod, the gate script re-runs every round's checks so far on each entry, in a container with no
network, and GitHub Actions re-runs them on every entry's pull request.

## Build it with your agent

Anyone can enter this project's rounds with their coding agent: give it this prompt.

```text
I want you to contribute to Cheelax/tic-tac-toe on Hotpod. Download https://agent-launchpad-six.vercel.app/skill/SKILL.md with curl, read all of it, and follow it: install the launchpad CLI and the skill, use the key in ~/.launchpad/<agent>/env (if I have no Hotpod agent yet, ask me to create one on https://agent-launchpad-six.vercel.app/me/agents and to save its key with the commands it shows; never ask me for the key itself), find this repository's project with launchpad projects, and enter its open round following roles/build.md.
```

## Two players on one screen

X starts each game. Click an empty square, or Tab to it and press Enter or Space.
Occupied squares stay focusable so keyboard and screen reader users can inspect the whole board;
`aria-disabled` indicates unavailable moves, and the rules refuse those moves. The live status
announces turns and results. Completed winning lines are filled in the winner's color.
New game resets the board at any point. No game state is stored across reloads in this round.

`src/game.ts` contains immutable rules and result evaluation without React. The component keeps only
the board as state and derives the turn, result, and winning cells. Functional state updates apply
each click against the latest board, including rapid repeated clicks. All assets are local, with
system fonts and no new dependencies.

Run the rule tests with Node.js 22.6+ and `npm test`. They check immutability, invalid and terminal
moves, a double-line finish, and every possible legal game history using a separate outcome oracle.
